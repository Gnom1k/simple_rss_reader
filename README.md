Sorry, I didn't use Ant, it was just Eclipse with Android SDK. I really tried to make the programm better than this, but electricity broke down for 2 days, which I totally lost. Since I knew about this task only last friday, I started to learn Android on saturday. This result - is around 5 days learning and coding from total scrath, since I knew nothing about Android. I hope you can count that in.
